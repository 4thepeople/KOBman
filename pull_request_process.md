Pull Request Process
===============================
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
The following are the steps for initiating a Pull request:-

1.After performing the modifications to the respective forked repository,generate a pull request to the original repository by using the 
  option "New Pull request" to get feedback on your proposed changes.

2.Type a title and description for your pull request.

3.The pull request is viewed in the "Comparing Changes" Page which will check if the forked repository and original repository are identical or not.

4.if not identical,it will initiate the pull request for the respective modification and thus forward it to the Original repository.

5.To create a pull request that is ready for review, click Create Pull Request. To create a draft pull request, use the drop-down and select Create Draft Pull Request, then click Draft Pull Request. For more information about draft pull requests, see "About pull requests."
